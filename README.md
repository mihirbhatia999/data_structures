# Information Systems 
Code that can be used by anyone that needs to understand and implement search/sort algorithms in Python or implement password protection system. 

# Search/Sort algorithms and Data Structures (Arrays, Linked Lists, Graphs)
1) Bubble Sort 
2) Merge Sort 
3) Brute Force Search 
4) Binary Search 
5) Breadth First Search (BFS) 
6) Depth First Search (DFS)
7) Linked List 

# To-Do List with Javascript 
A basic To-Do list in Javascript implemented using cells and tables. The interactive To-Do list enables user to: 
1) Input a task and its deadline
2) Color coding is provided as per the number of days remaining until the deadline
3) Remove a completed task 

# Upload Pandas Dataframe to MySQL server 
Execute MySQL queries in python to upload an entire pandas dataframe on a MySQL server. Once uploaded SQL queries are written in the python code itself to extract information from this database. 

# Simple Password Protection
A simple password protection system with a ledger of the usernames and passwords maintained as .txt files. This gives a simple understand of implementation of PHP to develop a password protection interface and how a server side and client side scripting works. Encryption using RSA or Hash Tables can be implemented as  a layer of protection for further implementation of this system

# Totient Function - for encryption 
The totient function is crucial for RSA encryption. This totient.py files allows a user to calculate the totient function. It also displays the time it takes to compute the totient function.
